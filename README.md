# Final Project – “Sprivaten” Website Clone

This is the final exam project: a front-end recreation of the “Sprivaten” website. It is a static multi-section site built with HTML and CSS, using local assets for images, icons and graphics.  

> Repository: https://github.com/Burdulaa/Final-Project

## Overview

The goal of this project is to practise building a complete, real-world style marketing website:

- Recreating the look and feel of the “Sprivaten” site
- Structuring multiple sections on a single page
- Using a CSS reset and custom styles
- Organising all images and assets in a dedicated folder (`Assets/`) 
Everything is static and runs entirely in the browser.

## Features

- **Single-page layout**: `index.html` is the main entry point 
- **Assets folder**: `Assets/` contains images and other static files used across the layout 
- **Reset + custom styles**:
  - `reset.css` – normalises default browser styles
  - `styles.css` – main styling for layout, typography, colours and components 
- **Typical sections** (depending on the original “Sprivaten” design):
  - Hero/intro with main headline and call-to-action
  - Information sections (about, benefits, how it works)
  - Cards or feature blocks
  - Pricing/offer or timetable area
  - Footer with additional info/links
- **Pure front-end**: no JavaScript logic, no backend (HTML + CSS only). 

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with a reset stylesheet)
